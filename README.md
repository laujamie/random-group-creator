# Random Group Creator

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4fc3815f-69d2-44d2-9c93-bb69633d0348/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/randomize-groups/deploys)

A simple webapp built in React to easily create random groups from a CSV. Allows users to
create random groups with desired proportions (i.e. having a certain people within an age range
in each group), to make creating balanced random groups easier.

This was built using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Mantine.
