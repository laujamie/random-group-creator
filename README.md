A simple webapp built in React to easily create random groups from a CSV. Allows users to
create random groups with desired proportions (i.e. having a certain people within an age range
in each group), to make creating balanced random groups easier.

## Demo

A demo of this app can be found [here](https://randomize-groups.netlify.app/).
